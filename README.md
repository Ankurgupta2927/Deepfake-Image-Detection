Deepfake Image Detection Using MobileNetV2
Overview
This repository implements a deepfake image detection system using MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model and a Flask-based web application for the user interface. The system allows users to upload an image and receive a response indicating whether the image is real or fake.

Features
MobileNetV2 Pre-trained Model: Utilizes MobileNetV2 to detect deepfakes efficiently.
Custom Dataset Training: Allows for fine-tuning on deepfake datasets.
Flask Web Application: A simple UI where users can upload an image and receive detection results.
Real-Time Detection: Instantly displays whether the uploaded image is real or fake.
Architecture
Model: The core of the detection system is built using MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network.
Web Interface: The UI is built using Flask, enabling users to interact with the model through a browser.
